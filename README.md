# React Accordion with JSON Data

## Overview
This is a simple React application that fetches data from a REST API and displays it in an accordion-style UI. The data is retrieved from the `jsonplaceholder.typicode.com` API, and users can expand/collapse each item to view more details.

## Features
- Fetches data dynamically from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`
- Displays fetched data using an interactive accordion layout
- Utilizes `react-hooks` (`useState`, `useEffect`) for state management
- Uses `react-icons` for expand/collapse indicators
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Styled with CSS for a clean UI

## Technologies Used
- **React**: JavaScript library for building UI components
- **React Hooks**: Used for managing component state and side effects
- **Fetch API**: For making HTTP requests to retrieve data
- **React Icons**: For visually appealing expand/collapse indicators
- **CSS**: Custom styles for improved UI/UX

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v14+ recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Steps to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-accordion.git
   cd react-accordion
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Project Structure
```
react-accordion/
│── public/                 # Static assets
│── src/
│   │── components/
│   │   │── Data.js         # Accordion component
│   │── App.js              # Main application component
│   │── index.js            # Entry point
│   │── App.css             # Styles for the application
│── package.json            # Project dependencies
│── README.md               # Project documentation
```

## How It Works
1. **Fetching Data**: 
   - The `App.js` component fetches data from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts` when the component mounts.
   - It stores the fetched data in the `showData` state variable.
   
2. **Rendering the Accordion**:
   - The `Data.js` component takes in `title` and `body` props and displays them inside an expandable section.
   - Clicking on an accordion item toggles its visibility using the `useState` hook.
   - `react-icons` provides visual indicators for expansion (`FcExpand`) and collapse (`FcCollapse`).

3. **Styling**:
   - The application is styled using CSS (`App.css`) to ensure a clean and responsive design.
